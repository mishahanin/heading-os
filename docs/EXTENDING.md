# Extending the engine

How to build on HEADING OS: add a skill, a rule, or a script, and clear the gates
before declaring it done. This is the developer how-to. The contribution policy (open
an issue first; pull requests are by invitation) lives in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mishahanin/heading-os/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md);
read it before sending code.

## 0. Dev setup

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --group dev   # core + all integration extras + dev tools (pytest, ruff, pre-commit)
pre-commit install                 # arm the commit-time gates (once per clone)
uv run python scripts/run-tests.py
```

A green test run on a fresh clone means your environment is sound.

## 1. The shape of the engine

Four kinds of artifact, each with its own home and conventions:

| Artifact | Lives in | Is |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | a slash-command workflow, routed from natural language |
| Rule | `.claude/rules/*.md` | always-on or path-scoped behavior the agent follows |
| Script | `scripts/*.py` | a CLI tool or daemon; shared code in `scripts/utils/` |
| Hook | wired in `.claude/settings*.json` | a `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `SessionStart` guard |

Before building anything: search for an existing pattern and reuse it. The standards
below are summarized from the engine's own development rules.

Editing the documentation site itself (`docs/`) has its own contract: every page is
either Markdown-sourced (regenerated) or hand-authored HTML, and a drift guard fails
the build if the two fall out of sync. See [DOCS-PIPELINE.md](DOCS-PIPELINE.html)
before editing anything under `docs/`.

## 2. Writing a skill

A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md`. The frontmatter is a contract:

```yaml
---
name: example-skill                    # kebab-case
description: >                          # what it does, when to use, AND when NOT to
  One paragraph. Name the alternative skill for the cases this one should not handle.
argument-hint: "[target]"
allowed-tools: "Read, Bash(python3:*)"  # least privilege
metadata:
  author: Your Name
  email: you@example.com
  version: "1.0"
x-heading-orchestration:                    # how the orchestrator may dispatch it
  parallel_safe: false                  # true | partial | false
  shared_state: []                      # paths it writes to
  triggers: ["example phrase"]          # natural-language triggers, or []
---
```

Rules of the road:

- **Body under 500 lines.** Overflow goes in a `references/` subdirectory.
- **Phased structure.** Phase 0 loads context, Phase 1 executes, Phase 2 synthesizes,
  Phase 3 outputs. Include a `NEVER` section listing prohibitions.
- **Routing-sensitive skills ship `triggers.json`** (6 to 10 positive and negative
  cases) and an entry in the skill router, so a new skill cannot silently hijack
  another's queries.
- **Invocation control.** Add `disable-model-invocation: true` for high-blast-radius
  skills that should fire only on an explicit slash command.

The `/skill-creator` skill scaffolds and evaluates a new skill against these
standards.

---

## 3. Writing a rule

Rules in `.claude/rules/` load automatically. A rule with no frontmatter is always
active; a rule with a `paths:` list loads only when work touches those paths:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "scripts/**"
---
```

Keep rules concise and single-purpose. Several existing rules encode security controls
(the send-gate, the engine/data separation, the secret guards); adapt brand and voice
rules freely, but leave the security ones in place.

---

## 4. Writing a script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""One-line purpose. Usage examples in the docstring."""
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent))
from scripts.utils.workspace import get_workspace_root   # reuse, don't reinvent
# ... argparse CLI ...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- **Naming.** `kebab-case.py` for CLI scripts you invoke directly; `snake_case.py` for
  anything in `scripts/utils/` or imported as a module (hyphens are illegal in Python
  module names).
- **Reuse `scripts/utils/`** for workspace paths, colors, API-key loading, and `.env`
  reads. Never hardcode paths; use `pathlib.Path` and the workspace helpers.
- **Data goes through the seam.** Write artifacts via the data-root helpers
  (`get_data_root()` / `get_*_dir()`), never into the engine tree.
- **Catch `HTTPError` before `URLError`** (the former is a subclass).

---

## 5. The gates before "done"

Run these on anything you add or change:

```bash
uv run python scripts/sanitize-text.py <file> --scan   # zero hidden characters
uv run python -m py_compile <script>                    # Python syntax
uv run python scripts/run-tests.py                      # the suite
```

`ruff` (the linter) and the secret scan run automatically through `pre-commit`. Then:

- **The pre-push gate.** `push-all.py` runs the full regression suite (parallelized
  with `pytest-xdist`) before a push is allowed, plus the unbypassable secret content
  scan. Budget time for it; do not work around it.
- **CodeQL** runs on the repository for static security analysis; address what it
  flags on a pull request.

### The slice standard

Non-trivial work runs on the seven numbered steps in
`scripts/utils/canopus_steps.py`, which is the only definition of them; the
`/canopus` skill summarises it and may never renumber it. Two of the seven are
the operator's: step 4, where he commits the plan and the RED test contract, and
step 7, where the work ships.

The approval is a COMMIT, not a lock file. `git show <sha>:<path>` reads the
frozen bytes, `git diff` answers whether the contract moved, and `git merge-base
--is-ancestor` answers whether the implementation descends from the approval.
Nothing on this machine holds those bytes down.

When the slice ships, it writes one committed markdown record per slice under
`records/slices/`, engine-relative paths only:

```bash
python scripts/canopus.py note <slug> --value "<one sentence>" \
    --approval-sha <sha> --contract tests/contract/<date>-<slug>/ \
    --plan-digest sha256:<...> --scrutinize-plan "<step 4 findings, all applied>" \
    --scrutinize-built "<step 6 findings, all applied>" \
    --undo "revert <sha>, restore <baseline>, re-run <cmd>"
```

Every flag there is required by the record's schema, which refuses an incomplete
note rather than writing one. A slice whose contract has been retired into the
ordinary suite adds `--retired-sha` and `--promoted-to`, and the schema refuses
the first without the second: a retirement pointing nowhere cannot be told apart
from a contract that was simply dropped.

`scripts/canopus_check.py` reads those records back over the repository they are
committed to, in four clauses. C1: the contract did not move between its approval
and the end of its life. C2: HEAD descends from the approval commit. C3: the
contract was RED at the approval sha, run in a worktree checked out there. C4:
the target is green at HEAD **and the junit report shows it RAN**, because
collected is not run and an all-skipped file exits 0. No clause reads a
timestamp: `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` and `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` are environment variables,
and on 2026-08-06 two of them put an implementation commit nine hours before the
approval it descends from.

```bash
python scripts/canopus.py check --range origin/main..HEAD
python scripts/canopus.py probe tests/contract/<date>-<slug>/
```

`check` is a passthrough to `scripts/canopus_check.py`, which is the module CI
runs directly, so the local reading and the CI reading are the same reading.

`probe` measures whether a contract's redness means anything: it null-stubs the
missing modules, so a test that ERRORS against the stub is vacuous, and it runs
three wrong implementations that exist and prints what each took of the red set.

**The honest limit.** A CI step in the `sovereignty guards` job runs
`canopus_check.py` on every push. It REPORTS a broken clause; it does not block
one, because `enforce_admins` is false on the only push path in use. Nothing on
this machine prevents a test contract from being edited by whoever is
implementing against it. Do not describe this as prevention.
---

## 6. Testing discipline

The suite lives in `tests/` (security tests in `tests/security/`). Every behavior you
change needs a test that exercises the real pattern through the public interface, not
an implementation detail. Write one test, make it pass, then the next.

When debugging, build a fast reproduction first: a failing test or a deterministic
harness that makes the bug appear and disappear on demand. Do not hypothesize about a
cause you cannot reproduce. Write the regression test before the fix, watch it fail,
apply the fix, watch it pass.

---

## 7. Restraint

- **Simplicity.** The minimum artifact that solves the problem. No speculative
  features, flags, or abstractions for single-use code.
- **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Do not refactor adjacent
  code, and match the style of the file you are editing.
- **No new dependency** without raising it in the issue first; pin exact versions.
- **Security and review findings override restraint.** Fix an open finding in a file
  you touch before the requested change, and say so if it widens the diff.
